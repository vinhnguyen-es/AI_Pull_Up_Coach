Pull-up repetition counter with motion-based detection.

This module implements the core pull-up counting algorithm using direction
change detection. It analyzes vertical movement patterns (wrist-shoulder distance)
to identify complete pull-up repetitions.

ALGORITHM OVERVIEW:
==================
The algorithm uses a state machine approach to detect complete pull-up motions:

1. POSITION TRACKING (30-frame sliding window)
   - Continuously monitors vertical distance between wrists and shoulders
   - A negative value means wrists are below shoulders (hanging position)
   - A less negative value means wrists are closer to shoulders (pulled up position)

2. DIRECTION DETECTION (with hysteresis to reduce noise)
   - Compares current position vs 5 frames ago to determine movement direction
   - Requires 3 consecutive frames to confirm a direction change
   - Three states: "up" (pulling), "down" (lowering), "stable" (minimal movement)

3. REP COUNTING (DOWN → UP pattern detection)
   - A complete rep = lowering phase (down) followed by pulling phase (up)
   - Validates that movement range is significant (30+ pixels minimum)
   - Enforces 2-second cooldown between reps to prevent false positives

4. VALIDATION
   - Minimum confidence check on keypoint detections (0.3)
   - Minimum movement range to ensure full range of motion
   - Cooldown period to prevent double-counting the same rep

KEYPOINT REFERENCE:
==================
YOLOv8 provides 17 body keypoints. We use:
- Shoulders (keypoints 5, 6): Reference points for body position
- Wrists (keypoints 9, 10): Track vertical movement during pull-up

The vertical difference (wrist_y - shoulder_y) is our primary measurement:
- More negative = lower position (hanging)
- Less negative = higher position (pulled up)

WARNING: The core detection logic in this file should NOT be modified
without thorough testing, as it affects rep counting accuracy.
